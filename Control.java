 * 
 * When a Solar P.V System is getting started a technician measure the Roof Width and Length
 * ,than calculate the number of PV Panels can be fitted.Once the PV array layout is designed,
 * the technician select the components and design the P.V system itself.
 * 
 * Since the Technician have to calculate lots of details the percent of a human error is high.
 * 
 * This Solar PV Site Survey and Equipment Calculation program, helps for make theSurvey 
 * and Design quickly and more accurately, while minimizing the possible human errors.
 * 
 * This Program is a Demo version, therefore the number of functions limited compare the full version
 * 
 * 
 * Main Menus Functions:
	1) Run Full Site Survey: Will run the Full program in sequenced Order
	2) Calculate Available Roof Area: Allows you to calculate the Absolute and 
		Usable Roof Area in meter squares
	3) Add PV Panels details: Allows you to set the Solar PV panels length, 
		and width for roof area comparison
	4) Calculate P.V Array Area: Allows you to calculate how many P.V panels could fit 
		in the examined roof in different layouts
	5) Display Full Report: When you run the full program, It will allows you to 
		Display your results in a GUI Window
